        This chapter features nearly 100 monster blocks designed to help you, the GM, create vivid
        and engaging encounters. Each block emphasizes color, sensory details, instincts,
        motivations, and adventure hooks over mechanical difficulty—in fact, there are no mechanics
        at all besides example traits and moves. As with all things in <Em>Grimwild</Em>, monsters
        map back to the core resolution mechanics. Monsters should be more than just something to
        carve through—they should feel integral to the story.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <Strong>The bestiary offers advice, not rules</Strong>: a collection of tropes and ideas for
        inspiration. It's not meant to be a comprehensive guide to these monsters, but instead a
        tool for quick reference and thinking outside the box with classic fantasy monsters. Some
        familiarity with them is assumed.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The monsters presented here blend tropes, personal twists, and efforts to make them more
        engaging than just “something that wants to eat you.” However, keep in mind that nothing
        here is canon—every idea is flexible, ready to be replaced, reimagined, or repurposed. These
        are just one interpretation of what these monsters might be. Change whatever you like; it
        won't break a thing.

      <List variant="unordered">
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Sensories</Strong>: Each entry lists colors, sights, sounds, and smells tied to
          the creature or its surroundings—sometimes describing the creature, other times the area
          or signs of its presence.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Traits &amp; Moves</Strong>: Suggest what a creature might do, especially in
          conflict, but are flexible and meant to inspire, even outside combat. Not all monsters are
          challenges.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Wants and Doesn't wants</Strong>: A creature's drives, offering direction and ways
          for PCs to interact. Share them, especially with experienced PCs.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Tables</Strong>: Inspire variants, introduce quest hooks, or define a purpose,
          adding depth to each.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Lack of Humanoids</Strong>: Common humanoid monsters like kobolds, orcs, and
          goblins are not listed.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Categories</Strong>: Blocks for demons, devils, dire animals, elementals, fey,
          hags, giants, and undead are grouped together.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Expanded Entries</Strong>: Some monsters, like balors and vampires, have
          double-sized entries featuring quests, linked challenges, or extra tables. These provide
          ready-to-use scenarios and examples for building and expanding your own.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Immunities &amp; Weaknesses</Strong>: Few specific resistances or vulnerabilities
          are listed. Basic logic applies—like undead resisting swords— and you can tweak for
          difficulty by adding your own. These entries are starting points meant to inspire creative
          customization.
