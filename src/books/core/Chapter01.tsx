        What is Grimwild?
      </Heading>
      <Text>
        <StrongEm>Grimwild is a game of cinematic fantasy adventure</StrongEm>. You go on quests,
        delve into dungeons, and explore the wilderness. It's set in a world of your choosing, or
        one you create together—the key being it's a world in need of adventurers. <Em>Grimwild</Em>{" "}
        isn't a setting. That's up to you. This game gives you the rules, monsters, and adventurers
        to play a campaign in that setting that feels like a fun, ensemble cast TV series, each
        session a new episode.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <StrongEm>Gameplay flows smoothly</StrongEm>. The rules resolve actions quickly, favoring
        the dramatic over the realistic. They provide a strong framework to pace the game, manage
        tension, and create great scenes. They give significant creative freedom to add set dressing
        and even larger details into scenes to play off of, keeping the story moving forward and
        prioritizing common sense over detailed tracking.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <StrongEm>The story is character-driven</StrongEm>. As players, you work together to decide
        your adventuring party's identity, then make characters that fit well within it. You set
        your group arcs, then choose your own character arcs, broad themes that give you experience
        when you bring them into play and help steer the story.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <StrongEm>Characters are revealed through play</StrongEm>. You start with a clear concept
        that fits well within your party, but you don't necessarily need all of the details
        upfront—focus on what sounds fun to bring into play. You can always use the tools the game
        gives you to add details about your past and connect the dots as they come up, leaving
        plenty of space to grow together into a cohesive, colorful party.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <StrongEm>Things get dramatic</StrongEm>. You're rewarded for playing into your traits in
        ways that complicate the situation, giving good reason to think in-character and sometimes
        picking the less than optimal path. Inevitably, sparks fly, leading to in-fighting between
        protagonists, just like any great story with characters driven by their own motivations.
        This is all cleanly resolved with quarrels—a simple roll to move things forward, encouraging
        and providing a release valve for this friction!
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <StrongEm>The story is a maelstrom of dice rolls and fun ideas</StrongEm>. From all this
        pushing and pulling on the narrative, storylines and side plots emerge. In spite of the
        tension, the choices you make about your party's arcs and the characters growing together
        over time give compelling reason to stay together and focused. It's a TV show that you're
        the main characters of, messy and fun and full of surprises.

        <StrongEm>Thematically</StrongEm>, <Em>Grimwild</Em> draws heavily on the heroic fantasy of{" "}
        <Em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</Em> and wears this influence on its sleeve. It's especially
        rooted in modern <Em>D&amp;D</Em>, from 3rd edition onwards. Inspiration was also taken from{" "}
        <Em>Dungeon World</Em> and its many descendants, like <Em>Unlimited Dungeons</Em>,{" "}

      <Text>
        <Em>Grimwild</Em> is built with the <StrongEm>Moxie</StrongEm> cinematic toolkit, a tabletop
        RPG ruleset that focuses on cinematic action and character-driven gameplay. Below is how the
        key parts tie together and an intro to the game's terms. The rules are explained throughout
        chapters 1 and 2, followed by <StrongEm>examples of play</StrongEm>. The game uses a lot of
        its own terminology, so here's a <StrongEm>basic rundown of the key parts</StrongEm> which
        you'll encounter throughout the rules. Don't worry about understanding all of this right
        now!
      </Text>
      <Section title="Setting up the Game">
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>As a group</StrongEm>, form an <Strong>adventuring party</Strong> by choosing a
          few key words that clearly say <Em>what your party is</Em> and <Em>what it's not</Em>.
          Your PCs have already adventured together, each fitting into the party concept in some
          way. This cuts right to the story in progress, ready to jump into your next adventure.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Make characters by choosing two <Strong>backgrounds</Strong> that reflect your past, like
          your heritage and professions, along with an <Strong>adventurer path</Strong> that grants
          a powerful <Strong>core talent</Strong>. Assign <Strong>stats</Strong>,{" "}
          <Strong>traits</Strong>, and <Strong>desires</Strong>, then forge <Strong>bonds</Strong>{" "}
          with the other PCs. Establish group and character <Strong>story arcs</Strong>, which you
          play towards to drive the story.

      </Section>
      <Section title="Playing the Game">
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>As a player</StrongEm>, describe what your character thinks, feels, and does.
          When you try something risky, you make an <Strong>action roll</Strong>. When the GM puts
          you in direct danger, you make a <Strong>defense roll</Strong>. You can also make a{" "}
          <Strong>montage roll</Strong> to skip past parts you don't want to play out in detail.
          Rolls are made with a handful of d6s equal to a stat, keeping the highest to set the{" "}
          <Strong>outcome</Strong>: <Strong>perfect</Strong>, <Strong>messy</Strong>, or{" "}
          <Strong>grim</Strong>. Rolling two 6s is a <Strong>critical</Strong> and you choose a
          bonus. Difficulty and damage add one or more d8s called <Strong>thorns</Strong> to your
          roll, which might <Strong>cut</Strong> the outcome down a level. If a grim gets cut, it's
          a <Strong>disaster</Strong> and things get really bad for you!
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Use your creative freedom to add <Strong>set dressing</Strong> to scenes to play off of,
          and a narrative currency called <Strong>story</Strong> to declare significant{" "}
          <Strong>story details</Strong> to push the fiction. Earn <Strong>spark</Strong> by
          introducing character-related complications called <Strong>tangles</Strong> and facing
          adversity, then spend it to gain a bonus on rolls.

        <Text>
          <StrongEm>As the GM</StrongEm>, present dilemmas and drama, then let the players come up
          with solutions. Keep the spotlight moving to give everyone screen time and prompt the
          players to describe their actions. Map the fiction to rules, and make rulings to fill in
          gaps. Open the door wide for collaboration and enjoy the story.

        <Text>
          Use <Strong>GM moves</Strong> as tools and guiding principles to act as the world and pace

        <Em>Grimwild</Em> is built with the <Em>Moxie</Em> ruleset and designed for{" "}

        <Em>shared imagination space</Em>, <Em>managing the spotlight</Em>, and{" "}
        <Em>diving into narration</Em>. The rules will get you halfway there—they're all pointing
        towards keeping the pace flowing quickly and the action dramatic. The other half is in your
        hands, the players at the table, and the attitude you all approach the game with.
      </Text>
      <Section title="Play Cinematically" titleVariant="solid">
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>Trust in the collaborative process</StrongEm>. Everyone at the table adds
          details into the story. You have to work together and play off of each other or the game,
          and the story you're telling, will fall flat.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>Use the camera, your shared imagination</StrongEm>. Each player has two
          perspectives, from your character and as the audience watching this TV show. Use the
          camera and vivid description to paint a cool scene in everyone's mind.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>Tell us what it looks like, before and after your rolls</StrongEm>. Give details
          about what you do, don't just leave it at broad statements. Zoom in and out. Use the
          camera to show things outside of your own character as well—pan around, cut to other
          scenes, and describe NPCs. Invoke cinematic vibes and create great scenes.

          <StrongEm>Don't be a weasel</StrongEm>. Do what your character would do, then let the GM
          map it back to the rules. Don't overdo it trying to work your way into better rolls. The
          fun is letting the story flow naturally. When you ask the rules what happens next, follow
          where it points with enthusiasm.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>Separate player and character knowledge</StrongEm>. It's more fun when everyone
          knows what's going on in the game. Don't keep secrets from each other, keep them from
          characters. As a player, be aware of what your character knows and doesn't know and play
          towards both.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>Use the meta-channel sparingly</StrongEm>. This is conversation about the game
          between players. It's unavoidable, but minimize it to keep that shared imagination in sync
          at the table. For anything longer than a quick question, call for a pause to talk things
          through, a clean break point to resume from later.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>Know the rules</StrongEm>. Everyone can get a copy of the game PDF (
          <Em>it's free!</Em>). The rules say a lot about the types of stories to be told with the
          game, and the less time you spend talking about the rules, the more time you have for
          roleplaying. Making a cheat sheet on rules you often forget can be a big help, or even
          just skimming the book pre-game.

          Think of the game as a series of improv prompts, posed by yourselves and the rules. When
          you respond to them, consider the following:
        </Text>
        <List>
          <List.Item>
            <Em>What would my character do?</Em>

        <Text>
          <StrongEm>Don't talk yourself out of fun</StrongEm>. The first idea that jumps into your
          head is often the one you should go with. Don't overthink or rationalize yourself out of
          it. Like any great TV show character, go where the fun lies. Great stories involve
          excitement, danger, and hard choices.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>Open doors and step through them</StrongEm>. The best scenes involve characters
          playing off of each other, so make chances for others to get involved. When someone
          invites you into a scene, step through that door—even if it means a bit of mental
          gymnastics to justify your character's actions. And as long as you step through the door
          at times, remember that it can be just as interesting to close the door instead.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>Work the spotlight</StrongEm>. There's no turn order of any kind, but there is

        Group arcs unite players around a theme, while character arcs help you express your own

        story details tied to your arcs to bring them into play!

        Spells are cast using <Strong>touchstones</Strong>
        —key terms like spell names, godly domains, or item descriptions. You interpret these

          <Strong smallCaps>Touchstone Limitations</Strong>: When you take a magic talent, have a
          discussion with the GM about what your magic can and can't do. Clearly defining it in this
          way makes the magic more fun to play with—{" "}
          <StrongEm>creativity thrives within limitations</StrongEm>. If a PC's magic feels too
          broad during the campaign, consider discussing new limitations to keep it balanced and

              A shadow sorcerer might limit their magic so shadows can never cause physical harm, or
              they might make them tangible but useless in direct sunlight. Most limitations arise
              naturally from the touchstones.

      <Section title="Spellcasting Rulings" titleVariant="solid">
        <Text>
          Magic's a freeform system, built on flexibility and creative rulings from the GM, with the
          understanding that its freedom is meant to preserve the feeling of magic. While this
          system can be exploited in unfun ways aimed at “winning,” it relies on you buying into
          your magic touchstones and the magnitudes of magic. <StrongEm>Don't be a weasel</StrongEm>
          —play in good faith and have fun with the freedom it gives you. With that in mind, here
          are some common rulings for various situations involving magic:
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Magic Trappings</Strong>: Discuss with the GM how your casting appears, its visual
          style, movements you make, and tools you use. All magic is clear and evident—trying to
          hide it is extremely difficult at best, but usually impossible. Losing implements or being
          hindered can deny permission to cast or inflict thorns.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Magic on Defense Rolls</Strong>: The GM chooses the stat for defense rolls, and
          can choose to let you use spellcasting. This counts as set dressing and doesn't cost a
          resource, like dice dropped from a pool. If the GM calls for another stat, but you have a
          clear spell-based counter, you can ask them if you have time to cast a spell instead. This
          is a spell as usual and it's the GM's choice if you have time.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Assisting with Magic</Strong>: Using magic to assist a roll is just set dressing
          with no cost—just keep the narration reasonable (the weaker end of a spell). Remember
          you're assisting. If you're making the action roll on a group level, cast as usual.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Detecting Magic</Strong>: With a relevant touchstone, you can recognize magic
          easily. Without one, it's harder, though magic ability counts as a factor. Without
          training, the magic must be very obvious to be noticed.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Dispelling Magic</Strong>: Anyone aware that something is magic can try to dispel
          it. This does not require training—you can cast a spell with relevant touchstones that
          counters it, cause enough of a disturbance to it (smashing the arcane shield with a
          battleaxe, shaking someone until they're no longer charmed), or outsmarting the magic's
          logic in some way (throwing water on a fire spell). Creativity should be rewarded here.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Healing Magic</Strong>: Spells can clear marks, heal minor conditions, or calm a
          vex response. Potent spells can pull off +3t/<Em>impossible</Em> healing, such as healing
          harm instantly or curing major conditions{" "}
          <Muted>mend a broken bone, but not a severed arm</Muted>. Rituals are needed for more
          extreme conditions like regrowing limbs, curing blindness, or removing deep trauma.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Resurrection</Strong>: Bringing back the dead is a costly, extremely risky ritual
          rarely worth the price you'll surely have to pay. Tread carefully.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Buffs &amp; Debuffs</Strong>: Spells that help or hinder are considered on a
          case-by-case basis, with the player and GM working together. As a starting point, a buff
          can apply the effects of a <StrongEm>critical</StrongEm>:{" "}
          <Em>greater effect—secondary effect—setup</Em>. Debuffs can do the same for anyone working
          against the foe. They can also add vantage <Muted>the ability to fly, invisibility</Muted>
          . Potent buffs might last longer, affect multiple targets, make +0t rolls automatically
          successful, or allow for a potent feat. Get creative with applying the mechanics and
          capture the feeling the spell is going for.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Magic Duration</Strong>: As a rule of thumb, a spell lasts just a moment, maybe
          two, and a potent spell lasts for a scene. This is judged by the GM based on the intended
          effect, which you balance against the magnitude of spell.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Potions</Strong>: Magical items, like potions, that allow you to use them as tools
          require an action to apply, such as rolling Agility to throw and hit someone with a
          potion. The efficacy of a potion is usually automatic, based on what tier of potion it is,
          but you can make a story roll if it's unclear. The more powerful the potion, the more dice
          you roll for the story roll.

        magic.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <Strong>Anchors</Strong> for a ritual are chosen by the GM and players together. They should

      <Text>
        <Strong>Arcana</Strong> are rare artifacts of power, magic imbued in them through ritual or
        other esoteric forces. They grant <StrongEm>vantage</StrongEm>, letting you do what's
        otherwise impossible, or greatly enhance specific tasks by granting outside assistance, at a
        cost. Some create strange, unique effects tied to their creator's intent. As always, it's
        the GM's role to map fiction to rules for each arcana. Arcana have the same tiers as
        treasure: <StrongEm>minor</StrongEm>, <StrongEm>major</StrongEm>, and{" "}

        Arcana are generally tools for the GM, crafted to fit the campaign. The GM Crucible (
        <Em>pg. 29</Em>) is a great source of inspiration for designing them.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Arcana are what they are—they're truths within the fiction. They can do what their
        description says. A shortcut to creating one works like this, though. Start with an
        evocative name and a single touchstone word, then apply one or two Sorcery techniques (
        <Em>pg. 72</Em>): <Em>attack—creation—defense</Em>—{" "}
        <Em>enhancement—hindrance—influence—transformation—traversal</Em>. From that, you can build
        out the description. Or begin with the description and work backwards towards defining the
        touchstones.

        An arcana's power level can be balanced by giving it requirements, like the following:
      </Text>
      <List>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Activation</Strong>: Requires spending spark, pushing yourself, or another
          resource to activate.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Limited Usage</Strong>: Has a resource or power pool, usually 4d. At 0d, it must
          be recharged by satisfying a specific anchor, like a ritual.

      <Section title="Arcana Rulings" titleVariant="solid">
        <Text>
          Arcana are as flexible as spellcasting—if not more so—and demand just as much creativity
          and GM rulings when used. Here are some examples:
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Wands and similar</Strong>: Bestow spellcasting ability on those wielding them.
          They have limited usage, a power pool rolled to cast from them. They don't require
          training to use.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Potions and similar</Strong>: Potions have a magnitude one level higher than its
          tier. <Em>A Minor Healing Potion</Em> can accomplish what a spell can (heal a mark).{" "}
          <Em>Major potions</Em> are potent spell effects and Mythic potions are ritual-level
          effects.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Scrolls</Strong>: Single-use arcana that match the tier of their effects, unlike
          other consumables. Lacking vantage to cast spells means you take thorns casting from them.
          Scrolls are also highly sought after for learning spells with the wizard's Spellcraft
          talent (<Em>pg. 76</Em>).
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Crafting Arcana</Strong>: The act of binding magic to items requires a ritual and
          a source of magic with the proper touchstones to make it. A ritual of creation generally
          takes far longer, though is often less dangerous, than merely achieving the same effect
          through a ritual.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Purchasing Arcana</Strong>: Prices depend entirely on the seller's desires,
          usually something other than coin. Finding one for sale is exceedingly rare, but you might
          locate someone willing to craft it for you for the right price.

        You tell the GM you want to punch the guy in the face, so he calls for a Brawn roll.
        Confused, you rewind a bit and explain that you're sucker punching him, and it's mostly just
        to get him to back down. Seeing the situation more clearly now, the GM calls for Agility.

        The fighter grabs the orc by the shirt and threatens him, but the orc's not budging. The GM
        makes his impact move—the price for the horses just doubled, and you all have nowhere near
        enough treasure.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        You step up and try a softer approach, negotiating with Presence at +1t from the price
        doubling. You roll 3d1t and get 4, 6, 6 - 7 :: <Strong>critical</Strong>! In spite of the
        price, your critical ignores the cut. You get the horses for the cost of the treasure and
        choose a secondary effect—you want to make sure this orc remains friendly permanently. The

        You want to climb up this cliff to get away from the goblins shooting arrows at you. The GM
        has you roll Agility and adds a thorn to represent the goblins. You roll a 5 - 7 ::{" "}
        <Strong>grim</Strong>. Your messy gets cut by the 7 and turns into a grim. The GM lets you
        know you're getting an arrow in your back and falling back down the wall, ending up
        bloodied. You start gleefully narrating how horribly it goes.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        You decide to make a second attempt. This time, you spend spark and now have another thorn
        from being bloodied. You roll 2d2t and get 6, 3 - 7, 1 :: <Strong>messy</Strong>. The messy
        means you did it, so the GM thinks on the consequences and makes you rattled. That was one
        scary as hell climb. Once again, you get to narrating your near-demise.

          It's possible to roll again for the same thing, as long as the situation's changed. If

        </Text>
        <Text>
          One very important point is that messy is successful, it's just not pretty. Here the GM
          faces a bit of a dilemma—you're being shot at with arrows. If you took bloodied, you could
          have died. But you did make it to the top of the cliff. They went with rattled due to how
          terrifying it was, but bloodied could have worked as well. It's just that you would have
          been dropped at the top.

        You call the guard over to distract him with chit-chat, rolling Presence and get 3, 6 ::{" "}
        <Strong>perfect</Strong>! This gives your rogue friend a chance to pick the lock. They spent
        a story point to have found some wire they could finagle into a makeshift lockpick, but
        using it on the lock is still +2t. They roll Agility, getting 3, 4, 2 - 7, 8 ::{" "}
        <Strong>disaster</Strong>! The messy (4) is cut by the thorns twice (7, 8) from a messy to a
        grim, then to a disaster. The lock opens, but the GM makes two impact moves here. The guard
        runs over, kicks the door, bloodies the rogue, and slams it shut, locking it.
      </Text>
      <Panel textSize="small">
        <Text>
          Without spending that story, the rogue wouldn't have even been able to pick the lock. Had
          the guard been watching, the difficulty (+3t) would have also prevented them from trying.
          These are the kinds of factors players and GMs must consider when judging rolls, and how
          thorns can affect the outcomes.

        You want to cast a healing spell to remove an arrow from the rogue. The wizard and fighter
        assist. The GM decides you make the action roll, which ends up being a 2, 4, 1. The fighter
        rolls a 1 and the wizard a 6. The end result is 2, 4, 1, 1, 6 :: <Strong>perfect</Strong>!

        You start narrating. Your describe your healing spell going awry and things getting real
        bloody. The rogue starts fighting it and the fighter says they can't quite hold the

          In this case, the healer is most important so they're leading the roll. If nobody had

        As the session winds to a close, the GM calls for a montage roll to escape the collapsing
        dungeon. You're bloodied, so you have a thorn and roll 1, 1 :: 7, <Strong>disaster</Strong>.
        The wizard in your group rolls 2, 2 :: <Strong>grim</Strong>. The fighter rolls a 4, 2 ::{" "}
        <Strong>messy</Strong>! The best outcome is a messy, so the overall outcome is a messy. You

        You already have an Agility mark, so it goes to Brawn—that's marked, too, so it goes to

        roll and get a <Strong>messy</Strong>, completely knocked out.

      <Text>
        The wizard describes getting everyone lost in the tunnels. You narrate collapsing from your
        wounds, telling the group to leave you behind. The fighter refuses, hoists you over their
        shoulder, and heads in a single direction—and somehow finds their way to the surface!
      </Text>

        Outside, the rogue stands waiting and cheekily asks what took you so long. They were

          Had the overall result here been a grim, it may have been a good idea to zoom in on a
          tough scene as they get caught fleeing the dungeon. The GM could have inflicted those
          marks, dropped your character even, then started the scene off.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          This is a good look at how damage escalates. If Brawn wasn't marked, you could have gotten
          away with just a mark even if you were already bloodied. Unfortunately, the adventure had
          taken a toll and just that last small hit was the straw that broke the camel's back.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          A 2d roll on dropped is a good default. That last hit was from a mark, so unlikely to have
          killed you. Even 3d would have been okay.

        You're walking through the library at night when an assassin strikes from above. This could

      <Text>
        You take +1t since the assassin has the drop on you. You get 6, 1 - 8 ::{" "}

          The GM has a lot of flexibility in choosing the defense they want to test—and testing the

          The GM could have made this Brawn if the assassin had tried to garrote them, or Wits if

        You have a special pack of blessed incense you brought from your home temple. It's a{" "}
        <Em>4d resource pool</Em>. Each time you use it, it triggers a roll to see how much is
        remaining. The first time you use it, you roll 4d and get 6, 2, 6, 4. The 2 result drops the
        pool by 1, <Strong>4d→3d</Strong>. The next time you use it, you roll 3d and get 4 5 5.
        Nothing is dropped from the pool! While you did use it, the pool's an abstract measurement
        of how much is remaining and doesn't change this time. The final time, though, you roll 3d

          tangles. When they change, you should also let your group see it play out.

        The heir must survive as the battle turns into a rout. Just then, you introduce a tangle—you
        spot your nemesis, Mortica, across the battlefield. By choosing the tangle, you risk the
        mission to protect the heir, but your vengeance is more important. You take spark.

        The GM decides to make a 2d story roll and lets you know first what might happen. On a
        perfect, you spot her first. On a grim, she spots you first. On a messy, you both spot each
        other.

          Here we see the player introducing story details via a tangle instead of using story,
          which is completely fine.

          On a perfect, you might also consider another tangle—to wait until Mortica sees her to
          engage honorably. Mortica, however, would definitely blindside you with an impact move on
          that grim.

        Fleeing from a massive cave troll, you spend story and invoke your Dwarf of the Deepmoot
        heritage's underground navigation wise. You say you spot a tight side tunnel to lead the
        troll in to fight it. The GM decides the cave troll can't maneuver well and +2t becomes +1t.

          A cave troll is massively dangerous, +2t, but if it can't maneuver well, it's only kind of
          dangerous. Story can definitely be used to gain mechanical advantage like this.

        You start the game with the character arcs Enjoy Life and Keep a Secret, which makes sense
        since you're the runaway heir to the Orchard Kingdom. Your job is to find ways to express
        these arcs through play, especially growth arcs like <StrongEm>Enjoying Life</StrongEm>. The
        GM's job is to challenge them and offer opportunity, especially a crisis arc like{" "}
        <StrongEm>Keeping a Secret</StrongEm>. It's clear that you don't want to live a life of
        responsibility, but that life will come calling whether you like it or not.

          The game will hum along just fine without story arcs. They're a player tool that expands
          vantage and lets you push the story towards what you want to be doing. They tell the GM,
          and other players, that you are interested in these themes.

        As you enter the small city, you remember your Settle Debts story arc and want to explore
        it. You spend story and declare that the father you never knew is here and you've carried
        this chip on your shoulder a long time—now's the time to confront him.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Through play, you learn that your father has become a benevolent guild leader in the city,
        looked up to by all. Not very interested in bringing down someone helpful to the community,
        you bury the feelings and move on. You take spark for finishing the arc.

          Here, you don't use a tangle, instead opting to spend story. Tangles are always bad, while
          story just makes things happen.

          Arcs aren't prescriptive. They don't have any ending in mind. Whether you accomplish it,
          end it through failing at it, or just give up on it, you take spark as your character
          finds something new to drive them.

        You want to spend story to add a detail about the guard dozing off to create a new
        opportunity to sneak in, but the GM vetoes it—they established earlier that the Toadking
        runs a very disciplined army. While not impossible to occur, it still feels off.

          Hunting for mechanical advantage with story is okay, but it's best used to enable scenes
          you want to explore and bypass those you don't. Still, the Toadking says you have to deal
          with the guards here.

        Your party meets with the archmage, who reveals a dark secret about your past. The GM
        targets your Presence to keep it together, adding a thorn—the secret is especially damning.
        You roll 4, 1, 5 - 7 :: <Strong>grim</Strong>. You're overwhelmed by memories, becoming
        rattled but choose to spend spark to take vex instead!
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Now you have a choice. You could <StrongEm>fight</StrongEm> and attack the archmage in a
        rage, someone your party sees as an ally. You could <StrongEm>flight</StrongEm> away from
        the group, back outside the tower. You could <StrongEm>freeze</StrongEm>, dropping the
        potion you intended to give the archmage. You could <StrongEm>freakout</StrongEm>, lashing
        out at your allies' shocked, judgmental stares.

          Rattled can be quite debilitating and vex is an easy out if you have spark, but it does
          come with the consequences—you have to play true and follow through in a way that makes
          sense.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Also, don't forget that you take +1t when you follow through due to the emotional turmoil!
          Not all vex responses require an action roll, though.

        The dragon roars! The party all roll Presence defense, getting <Strong>grims</Strong>.
        Everyone takes vex, terrified! You choose <StrongEm>flight</StrongEm> and scurry away to
        hide. The fighter decides to <StrongEm>freakout</StrongEm>, and runs to hide behind the
        wizard. The wizard <StrongEm>freezes</StrongEm>, dropping her spellbook, which the fighter
        kicks away. The cleric grabs his battlehammer and chooses to <StrongEm>fight</StrongEm>,
        charging towards certain doom.

          Vex gives a chance to really double down on who your character is or go in the exact
          opposite direction with something surprising. Either way, it's a big open door to
          roleplaying.
