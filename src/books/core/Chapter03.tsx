          Don't corner your character growth before starting. You might start as a <Em>Mariner</Em>,
          refine it to <Em>Pirate</Em>, then expand on it to <Em>Blackthorn Reaver</Em> or{" "}
          <Em>First Mate under Captain Stormclaw</Em> as it comes up in the story. Or you can just
          keep it simple!

        Paths &amp; Talents

      <Text>
        The remainder of this chapter details the 12 adventurer paths available in the game. Below,
        you'll find explanations of common options and terms used throughout the paths. These
        clarifications help you better understand how to customize your character and make use of
        talents.
      </Text>
      <List variant="ordered">
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Core Growth</Strong>: Your core talent powers up as you level. For “every 2
          levels,” gain bonuses at levels 2, 4, 6. For “every 3 levels,” it's 3, 6. Remember that 7
          is the maximum level.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Cross-Path Talents</Strong>: You're free to choose talents from other paths if
          they fit your char acter's story. Just explain how your character picked up these
          skills—it's a great way to add depth to your character.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Re-Skin Talents</Strong>: To avoid redundancy, similar talents across paths have
          been avoided. Instead, you're encouraged to “re-skin” talents to fit your character's
          theme. For example, the Bulwark (armor) talent could be reinterpreted as a magical mage
          shield for a wizard.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Push Yourself</Strong>: Some talents require you to push yourself to activate.
          <StrongEm>These talents can be activated once per session for free</StrongEm>. After the
          first use, you must push yourself as normal to activate it again, marking a relevant stat.
          Choose your moments wisely.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>“When Given Time”</Strong>: This phrase included in several talents means you need
          time to do what the talent lets you, but how long that is leaves room for interpretation.
          Go with what makes sense, but at the very least it's a narrative beat, a PC action, or
          some time unhindered by disruptive forces. Use story rolls or group consensus to decide
          what counts.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>“Always”</Strong>: When a talent includes this specific wording, it means you have
          narrative permission to almost always do what's indicated. However, this can be stopped by
          a <Move>GM Counter</Move> move. It's best to think that “always” means 95% of the time.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Choices</Strong>: Italicized words separated by em dashes represent lists of
          choices, like: <Em>one—two—three</Em>. These represent a limited amount of options you
          must choose from. If instead a talent suggests a type of choice, saying{" "}
          <Em>“you can do things like A and B”</Em>, then you can extrapolate that out into other
          similar actions.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>On a Perfect</Strong>: Any talent that allows you to do something on a perfect, it
          also triggers on a critical.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          Optional Character Building: Some paths include additional character-building fea tures,
          marked with an [Optional] tag. If they're not relevant to your character, you can pass
          them up.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <Strong>Roleplaying Advice</Strong>: Some paths include advice on roleplaying that
          character path, especially on parts that might be somewhat unfamiliar. It's entirely
          optional, but if they resonate with you, lean into them to make those aspects important in
          the game.
        </List.Item>
      </List>

        In Chapter 7: Extras, you can also find a large list of distinctive features to choose from
        to help flesh out your characters, as well as party-building questions that help link
        together characters' backstories and add depth to their relationships.

          Each session, you can sing <Strong>3 bardsongs</Strong>, rolling Presence. Sing one to
          pull off a <StrongEm>potent feat of emotional influence</StrongEm>, like{" "}
          <Em>eliciting a vex response in an NPC</Em>, <Em>buffing a group of allies</Em>, or{" "}
          <Em>inflicting hindrances on enemies</Em>. You can also sing one to{" "}
          <StrongEm>interrupt</StrongEm> an impact move. A bardsong's effect flows from its
          composition. Choose a <StrongEm>style</StrongEm>,{" "}

            <em>tune</em>

        <Text>
          Each session, you can also sing <Strong>3 melodies</Strong>, spur of the moment tunes
          without specific composition. Spend them to: assist{" "}
          <Em>without risk—calm or intensify a vex response—clear a mark</Em>. These don't require a
          roll. You cannot affect yourself.

          or the like—within or nearby the scene. It gains awareness and purpose, forming a{" "}

          As a fighter, bring your mastery of battle into play. You've likely trained in various
          weapons and understand their matchups. Weapons don't have specific rules differentiating
          them, but they do carry fictional weight which can impact vantage. Highlight favorable
          matchups or embrace bad ones for interesting tangles. Take spark by accepting the risks or
          retreating from a likely loss.

          Action rolls let you flavor combat however you like—don't just swing a sword or jab a

          secondary effects to remove thorns or shift the fight. Don't tunnel vision on the
          kill—change the battle to end it faster! Of course, anyone can try these, but as a

          <Strong>Obligations</Strong>: Each patron has different demands. You have an extra story

          only for the lightest of service. You define what this means. Before each session, discuss
          this story arc. Your patron has an <StrongEm>8d Patience</StrongEm> pool. Roll it if your
          patron was not satisfied with your progress last session. At 0d, your patron will give you
          a visit in some form to <StrongEm>clear up the issue</StrongEm>, replenishing the pool.

          You can roll Presence to hex someone with:{" "}
