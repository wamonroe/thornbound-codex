        As the GM, you play the game by a different set of rules, utilizing the tools laid out in
        this chapter to craft an engaging and dynamic game. You wield GM moves and suspense to drive
        the narrative forward, challenges to model difficult tasks, the combat kit to create
        thrilling battles, and story rolls along with the GM crucible for inspiration when the
        unexpected arises.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Your primary role is mapping fiction to mechanics, keeping the players immersed in the story
        while you seamlessly weave the rules into the narrative, and know when to instead ditch a
        rule and just let the narrative take over.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Above all, be creative. Use the mechanics as a springboard to manufacture drama, tension,
        and memorable moments.

        <Strong allCaps>Story Rolls</Strong>. Roll to disclaim decision-making, letting the dice
        decide story questions when you don't want to, like an NPC's reaction, off-screen action, or
        how good or bad something that just happened is. You can also collapse any rule back to a
        story roll when there's no specific mechanic to map it to.

      <Text>
        Skipping an impact move feels like the PCs got off lucky—something <Em>should</Em> have
        happened, but didn't. That lingering suspense builds tension, ready to strike later. Use
        this when no immediate move feels compelling or when you want to shift focus to other

        </Text>
        <Text>
          Damage is a solid baseline: in a fight, injuries leave you bloodied by default. Other
          consequences, even narrative ones, should sting just as much. There's no strict formula—
          <Em>it's a gut feeling</Em>. Let the fiction guide you, and make sure to give the fiction
          its teeth.
        </Text>

          <StrongEm>
            You can split consequences, breaking big consequences into smaller ones
          </StrongEm>
          . Multiple effects can be just as effective and make more sense in the situation. You
          might break up bloodied into a few marks, or rattled becoming vex and rolling a pool
          instead. Splits make the story move in multiple directions.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          You can also spread consequences, hitting multiple PCs, nearby NPCs, or even a PC who
          didn't prompt the move. Consequences can be identical, vary in severity, or differ
          entirely. If a PC other than the one prompting it is hit, they get a defense roll. Spreads
          make the impact feel broader and pulling more people into a dynamic scene.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong allCaps>Thinking Offscreen</Strong>. Fallout that happens beyond the immediate
          action. Not all consequences need to occur in the spotlight. Hitting elsewhere builds
          tension, hastens incoming trouble, or creates missed opportunities. These unseen events
          make the world feel alive, adding depth beyond the present moment.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong allCaps>Using Pools</Strong>. Building pressure with danger or timer pools. Start
          or pressure or timer pool as another outlet for consequences, often{" "}
          <StrongEm>offscreen</StrongEm>. These create looming threats and situations the PCs want
          to avoid or mitigate. They build pressure and offer a strong alternative to skipping the
          move and banking suspense.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong allCaps>Stakes</Strong>. Framing danger when it's not the default. Most rolls
          assume meaningful consequences. Declaring <Strong>dire stakes</Strong> before a roll or
          situation signals severe stakes—death or worse looms <Muted>(an assassin strikes)</Muted>.{" "}
          <Strong>Tame stakes</Strong> shifts outcomes into lighter territory, rolling for things
          you'd normally skip, with softer consequences <Muted>(a cat's stuck in a tree)</Muted>.
          It's a tool for tone, moving between intense and light play.

        <Strong allCaps>Story Moves</Strong>. Keep the narrative flowing, the action engaging, and
        get things moving when they stall out. Player actions drive the story, and story moves nudge

        that makes sense. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, it's more satisfying when
        the players have <StrongEm>fair warning</StrongEm> about trouble. They know actions have
        consequences and suspense you've earned can come back to bite them. This feels fair, so
        outside of these you give them the initiative. It shows things aren't arbitrary—

        When not prompted by a roll, impact moves directly against a PC give them a defense roll.
        Some talents also give the ability to interrupt impact moves, possibly negating them. If the

        move.

          It's also great for adding a thorn to a roll by introducing sudden environmental
          obstacles, a great outlet for extra suspense that doesn't introduce new drama.

        <Text>
          <Strong smallCaps>Counter</Strong> to make the world tenaciously formidable, showing that
          it won't just roll over. You can stop anything a PC does, including successful action
          rolls, talents they “always” have permission to use and extra vigilance. If they use a
          talent that costs them resources, they generally don't have to expend that resource (your
          call) but can't quickly use it again. However, this can never be used to stop defense
          rolls and criticals—don't steal their thunder. Be careful, players get frustrated if their
          victories and advantages are snatched away, so use it in interesting ways and make sure
          the spotlight works its way back to them after you take advantage of the moment.

          <Strong smallCaps>Hit 'Em Hard</Strong> when you need to inflict direct consequences.
          Whether it's damage, betrayal, or loss, this move underscores the seriousness of the
          situation. It's a heavy reminder that the world pushes back against their actions. When
          you use it, you should be hitting them just as hard as they're trying to hit the world.

          <Strong smallCaps>Lock It In</Strong> to definitively close off an opportunity and close
          out a scene that's threatening to drag on. Players can be tenacious and keep trying to
          find some way to not be defeated. This puts a definitive end to a situation. It makes
          follow-up attempts impossible, which refocuses players' attention forward rather than
          trying to find yet another way to attempt something they've already failed at.

                Following the death of the Ember Queen, the realm descended into chaos sparking a
                long and bloody civil war. The PCs have managed to bring all three sides to the
                negotiating table, but the road to peace is rocky. They need each to sign off on
                splitting the realm.

                ready the barbed ballista, knowing they must prevent the beast from escaping into

        When a fight breaks out, the action flows naturally, following the spotlight. There are no
        specific rules that differentiate combat from any other scene.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <StrongEm>There's no turn order</StrongEm>. The GM describes the impending danger in the
        current situation and asks how the PCs respond, or the PCs take action on their own. The
        spotlight is often on the PCs, and the world's actions flow from what they do. You make
        enemies more proactive by <Move>Foreshadowing</Move> events and following up after, or
        spending suspense to make impact moves. This results in a cinematic ebb and flow to combat.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <StrongEm>Battles occur in the theater of the mind</StrongEm>, using the group's shared
        imagination to keep track of each participant's fictional positioning to map fiction to
        rules. However, using <StrongEm>battlemaps</StrongEm> or sketching maps with minis or
        markers to track locations during a fight works well, too. This helps organize the chaotic
        situation, makes sure everyone gets time to shine, and keeps everyone's imagination aligned.
        Don't get caught up in detailed tracking—update the map with big changes.

      <Section title="Combat Rulings" titleVariant="solid">
        <Text>
          You map the fiction to the rules just like any scene, making rulings to fill in gaps.
          However, in combat you'll often see the same scenarios come up, so for the sake of
          consistency, some common rulings:
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Movement</Strong>: Moving usually accompanies another action—the goal isn't just
          to get somewhere, but to get there and do something. If an interesting obstacle blocks the
          way, it needs an action roll.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Weapons</Strong>: Compare the weapons in play and use common sense to resolve any
          issues. Most weapons are evenly matched; the roll only shifts if there's a clear
          imbalance.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Melee combat</Strong>: Most melee attacks use Brawn, while light, fast weapons
          rely on Agility. Dirty tricks call for Wits, but rarely work more than once.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Ranged combat</Strong>: Precision attacks roll Agility, while thrown weapons use
          Brawn or Agility based on weight and range. Charging an enemy with ranged weapons is
          reckless, adding +1t or requiring a separate action to close the gap.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Ranged and Casters vs. Melee</Strong>: Spellcasting and precise ranged attacks
          demand focus, which is tough with nearby threats. Inflict +1t to these rolls when under
          immediate danger.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Defense Rolls</Strong>: The GM selects the stat to test. Melee attacks are dodged
          with Agility, blocked with Brawn (using armor or shields), anticipated with Wits, or
          keeping your nerve with Presence.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Armor</Strong>: Armor and shields are represented by talents like Bulwark (pg.
          62). Otherwise, they are vantage and set dressing for defense rolls.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Vulnerabilities</Strong>: Exploiting a vulnerability can lower thorns, drop 1
          before rolling a pool, or even bypass the need for a roll. In some cases, finding a
          vulnerability is required to attack at all.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <Strong>Enemy Magic</Strong>: Enemy magic doesn't follow the same rules as PC magic. It
          manifests through GM moves and is constrained only by the fiction.

        that for a reason. They shove the story forward. Players have a lot of tools at their
        disposal, so <StrongEm>give the world teeth</StrongEm>. It makes victory even sweeter.

      <Text>
        A single impact move is flexible. You can split it up into a few lesser effects{" "}
        <Muted>(inflict a mark as you break their sword)</Muted>, hit multiple PCs at once, or have
        a PC's action affect a totally different PC, though they do get a defense roll in that case.

      <Text>
        When an impact move doesn't naturally flow from what's happening on-screen (
        <Em>common with messy rolls</Em>), think off-screen instead and complicate their lives
        elsewhere or take suspense and hit later with better dramatic timing.

        <StrongEm>Prompt player narration</StrongEm>. After a roll, make sure the players narrate

        express their character. Collaborate, but keep them narrating their actions.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Encourage them to play off of each other as well, especially with assists and montages. Ask

        their bond affects their reaction.
      </Text>

        The cleric charges the Minotaur King. This minotaur is a powerful foe and the thorns it
        inflicts when fighting it must reflect that, so you make it +2t and call for a Brawn roll:
        2, 3, 5 - 7, 8. The initial outcome is a <Strong>messy</Strong>, which drops to a{" "}
        <Strong>grim</Strong> for the first cut, then to a <Strong>disaster</Strong> for the second.
        You hadn't declared dire stakes on this roll, but you know that a disaster can cut past the
        need. You check in with the cleric, “You okay losing a limb here?” Leaning into the
        awfulness of the situation, they laugh it off and nod. You decide the Minotaur King rips off
        their arm! You toss the narration back to the player to let them describe how it all went
        down.

          Horrifying enemies need horrifying consequences. If you hit hard, especially when the dice
          tell you to, players will understand—the world is dangerous. That's why what they're doing
          is heroic.
        </Text>
        <Text size="small" muted>
          Still, it's good to check in. You can't give a longterm condition like losing a limb to a
          player without their say so. Had they wanted to avoid that, you could have dropped them
          instead and risked death or found something equally fitting.

        The fighter stands off alone against 10 bandits. This one's borderline, but the bandits all
        have combat experience and there's an overwhelming number of them, so you make this
        impossible (+3t from inherent difficulty).
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The fighter thinks on it, then they take off running. They want to split the group up for
        better odds. You know this bunch is disorganized, so you decide a trick is relatively
        easy—no thorns, and you call for a wits roll: 4, 3 :: <Strong>messy</Strong>! You let them
        know they pulled it off, but the impact move means they're still facing three bandits —
        fightable, but still +1t. You also give them a mark to Agility as they stumble and twist
        their ankle.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The fighter grabs the narration and works in that the stumble is how the bandits ended up
        catching up to them. Then they introduce a tangle—they'll start off on the ground, in a
        terrible position, if they can have spark. You give the thumbs up!

        <Text size="small" muted>
          As GM, you have to be really on point and consistent with thorns. There are no hard rules,
          but it's easy to forget how tough enemy numbers can be. Even a great fighter will struggle
          against ten all coming at them.
        </Text>
        <Text size="small" muted>
          When considering whether to add a thorn, err on the side of adding it! It makes rolls more
          interesting with higher stakes, but also makes players not just try the first thing that
          comes to mind.
        </Text>
        <Text size="small" muted>
          Finally, splitting up consequences like this is a good way to keep scenes moving without
          hammering a PC as things get started. Give them a fighting chance to make for a cool
          scene. A perfect probably would have had them facing 2 bandits.

        The PCs have made a grave mistake, and the entire cemetery surrounding them is starting to
        come to unlife. You (the GM) tell them there are skeletons and zombies everywhere. They have
        a choice— they could run, and it would be an <Strong>8d | Escape</Strong> challenge, but the
        town would be gone for sure. Or you can stay and fight, just wave after wave of undead. You
        then <Move>Entangle</Move> the rogue's <StrongEm>definitely not honorable</StrongEm> trait.
        The rest seem deadset on staying, but the rogue wavers. They quarrel, and finally the other
        three win out—they stay, and fight like the heroes most of them are.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        You think on what waves of zombies might look like. Each undead is weak individually, but
        the entire horde is epic. You set it up as waves, three linked{" "}
        <Strong>4d-6d-8d | Undead Horde</Strong> challenges.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        You then call for a <Move>Buildup</Move> move. Each player describes their character getting
        ready as the horde starts to claw its way out of the ground. They take spark from the
        quarrel earlier, spark from the <Move>Buildup</Move> move, and the GM takes suspense.
      </Text>
      <Panel>
        <Text size="small" muted>
          Setting up challenges on the fly is one of the most important parts of being a GM. With
          time, it becomes second nature and lets you set up dynamic scenarios quickly.
        </Text>
        <Text size="small" muted>
          Don't forget about Buildup. This is perfect timing for it. They just got spark from
          quarreling, but a huge horde is incoming, and they're probably going to need more spark
          for narrating a great scene. Unfortunately, the rogue here got stuck with losing out on a
          spark—but it all happened so quickly that as the GM, you should give them a pass and let
          them have three (Entangle, quarrel, Buildup) just this once.
        </Text>
        <Text size="small" muted>
          Giving PCs opportunities to get spark like that as well incentivizes them using it. In
          these cases, usually one or two PCs will have spark still on their sheet and miss out on
          getting that second one as theirs is full.

        The <Strong>8d | Gnoll Marauders</Strong> begin their assault on the walled town. You spend

        <Em>6d Walls Breached</Em> pool: 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 6 :: <Strong>6d→3d</Strong>. If the gate
        falls, chaos will reign. The cleric casts a warding domain spell and gets a{" "}

        1, 6 :: <Strong>8d→4d</Strong>. For the critical, the wizard takes a{" "}
        <Em>secondary effect</Em>—they want that battering ram to catch fire. You think it'll
        probably take a while to burn, so you start a 4d Ram Burning pool and roll it: 2 3 3 1 ::

          This is a great example of secondary effect, and also how pools can quickly change the

        </Text>
        <Text size="small" muted>
          Had they chosen greater effect, you would have dropped 1d from the pool before rolling it.
          If they had went with setup, they could have rolled an assist without risk with whoever
          came at the gnolls next. Imagine a berserker flying off the wall, greataxe in hand,
          cutting through the exploding fireball at some surprised gnolls!

        Next, the wizard must walk across a very narrow balance beam (+1t). Her perfect gets cut to

        You decide that Wits gets marked, but the elders seem pleased (<Strong>3d→1d</Strong>). The

          And here's where it all comes together, the mix of setting up challenges, rolling pools,

          Throughout all of this, there's of course a lot more narration, but this is the ideal flow

        then make a move—<Move>Graze Reef</Move>. The rogue up in the lookout makes a Wits defense
        roll but gets a <Strong>grim</Strong>. They don't see it and the boat slams against the

        At the edge of catastrophe, the fighter tries to right the course. They spend spark and the

        <Move>Violent Winds</Move> puts a second thorn onto the roll, and you declare dire stakes at
        this pivotal moment. If this fails, the pools are rolled and one or more of the PCs is going

          Fail states provide an important check against neverending rolls to whittle down pools.
          Setting up a proper one, here the Storm Blowing In and even later a second one with Taking

        The player expected the leader to run away, but you check his role—<Strong>brute</Strong>. A
        smart enemy might flee, but not a brute. You make a 1d (unlikely) story roll for the rogue
        to see if the bandit runs and get a <Strong>grim</Strong>. Looks like it's a fight. You
        declare dire stakes, then make a move that was prompted by the story roll—
        <Move>Hit 'Em Hard</Move>.

          When in doubt about what an enemy would do, look to their role and go from there.

        The Bandit Leader charges from the bushes. The rogue rolls a <Strong>grim</Strong> and gets
        blindsided. You skip marked and go straight to bloodied. The rogue describes the attack,
        blood flying from a blow to the head. You use a buildup move and you both narrate a moment,
        the bandit looking to finish this, the rogue having a chance to stand up. They face off. The
        rogue takes spark, you take suspense. Now it's a fight.

          Story rolls have consequences, too. If something in the fiction leads to one, the story
          roll can prompt impact moves.

          Cinema like this is why we play the game. Imagine all this through the camera lens, your
          shared imagination space. When the mechanics flow like this, the system sings.
