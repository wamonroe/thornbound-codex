        Exploration is an adventure, and this pointcrawl system captures that spirit. It's about
        venturing into the unknown, both as your characters and as players, uncovering what lies
        ahead. As you explore, connections form naturally, and a narrative begins to emerge—one
        built from your experiences and the discoveries you yourselves have added to the region.
        It's discovery as PCs, but also as players, figuring out and creating a region together on
        the fly and finding the <StrongEm>wonder</StrongEm> and <StrongEm>drama</StrongEm> that lies
        within it.

      <Section title="What is the Grimwild?">
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>The Grimwild is a chaotic wildland</StrongEm>, a once sparsely populated
          borderland that was shattered by a cataclysm half a century ago. Within, three realities
          have collided—the original small towns and keeps, the ruins of a long-fallen empire, and a
          savage wilderness teeming with monsters. The Remnants, the Wilds, and the Ruins have fused
          into a surreal region that <StrongEm>defies logic and strict canon</StrongEm>, the three
          bleeding into each other across the Grimwild's expanse. Old settlements have either
          adapted or vanished, and survivors live in a tenuously strange existence where a dragon
          might nest beneath a town or farmers inhabit an ancient wizard's tower.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>It's a long corridor spanning harsh terrain</StrongEm>, a week's ride east to
          west and twice that north to south— if the way were clear. Such territory is rare in the
          Grimwild. Sheer cliffs line the stormy eastern coast, jagged mountains rise to the west,
          and dense forests and swamps choke the north and south. Surrounding the borders is the
          fog, impossibly dense.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          <StrongEm>
            To enter the fog and leave the Grimwild is to risk becoming lost forever
          </StrongEm>
          , never knowing which of the three realities you will emerge into. Expeditions into and
          out of the region rarely returned. The borderland was written off as a cursed wasteland by
          those outside. Those inside have learned their present situation is better than the
          horrors of the other realms. The Grimwild is isolated, left to its own fate.

        <Text>
          <StrongEm>The Grimwild is a canon-less sandbox</StrongEm> where you have the freedom to
          explore, discover, and make it all up as you go. Logical connections don't matter here,
          giving you the freedom to add whatever sounds fun to your party and let a storyline emerge
          through play. It is a land of discovery, one even its own inhabitants don't understand
          well.

        The Three Realities

      <Text>
        Below are some basic truths about the three realities that make up the Grimwild, a set of
        pillars for you to start building within and around. You can hang your own fiction off of
        them, or topple them over and create something totally different. The point is to make a
        sandbox that's easy to play in.

      <Text>
        Exploration is played out with a token-based system that lets players and the GM work
        together to create and draw out the world. You gain <Strong>exploration tokens</Strong>,
        then spend them to add things to the map, giving each player equal opportunity to have an
        impact, while the spending of a resource adds weight to the contributions.

        <StrongEm>You're creating a pointcrawl</StrongEm>. A pointcrawl maps out the meaningful
        locations (<Strong>points</Strong>) and the connections (<Strong>paths</Strong>) between
        them, focusing on what really matters. Everything outside those paths? Either it's tough to
        get through, or there's nothing worth finding there. This approach keeps the spotlight on
        the places and journeys that drive the story, cutting out the tedium and keeping exploration
        sharp, deliberate, and packed with interesting things to experience.

        <Text>
          Exploration tokens can be spent to add points and paths to the map. The token cost depends
          on the map type, covered over the next few pages. Generally, a <Strong>minor</Strong>{" "}
          point or path costs 1 token and a <Strong>major</Strong> point or path costs 2 tokens. You
          use paths to draw connections between the points or to lead you off into unexplored
          territory.
